# Ogbomoso Ignite | Brand Identity & UI Style Guide

## 1. Brand Color Overview
The Ogbomoso Ignite visual identity is built on a high-energy contrast between professional stability and innovative "spark." This palette is designed to reflect the intersection of technology and entrepreneurship.

### The Palette
* **Primary Deep Navy:** The foundation of the brand. Represents authority, trust, and professional stability.
* **Ignite Orange (Gradient Start):** Represents energy, action, and the "spark" of innovation.
* **Tech Yellow (Gradient End):** Represents growth, light, and the forward-moving result of tech-driven entrepreneurship.
* **Pure White:** The essential canvas to ensure a clean, modern, and high-contrast user experience.

## 2. UI Element Implementation Strategy

### Layout & Backgrounds
* **Main Background:** Use **Pure White** (#FFFFFF) for the majority of page real estate to maintain a "clean tech" aesthetic.
* **Section Breaks:** Utilize a very light tint of the Navy or a light grey to create subtle visual separation between different types of content.
* **Footers & Headers:** Use **Deep Navy** to "bookend" the page, giving the website a grounded and structured feel.

### Typography
* **Headings (H1, H2, H3):** Apply **Deep Navy**. This ensures high readability and immediate visual hierarchy.
* **Body Text:** Use a **Dark Charcoal or Navy-tinted Black**. This reduces the harshness of pure black while keeping the contrast high for accessibility.
* **Accents:** Use **Ignite Orange** sparingly for small labels or sub-headlines that need to catch the eye.

### Interactive Elements (Buttons & Links)
* **Primary Call to Action (CTA):** A **Linear Gradient** from Ignite Orange to Tech Yellow. This creates a "glowing" effect that demands user attention.
* **Secondary Actions:** Use **Solid Deep Navy** with white text. This provides a clear hierarchy so it doesn't compete with the main "Ignite" action.
* **Links:** Standard text links should use the **Orange** color to signify interactivity.

## 3. Visual Effects & Assets

### Shadows & Overlays
* **Image Overlays:** Apply a **60-80% opacity Deep Navy overlay** over background images. This allows white or orange text to remain legible regardless of the image content.
* **Shadows:** Avoid using neutral grey. Use a **Transparent Navy** (e.g., `rgba(0, 20, 40, 0.1)`) to create shadows that feel more integrated with the brand's specific color temperature.

### Iconography
* **Style:** Use the **Orange-to-Yellow gradient** for feature icons or bullet points to tie the "Ignite" theme into the body content of the site.

## 4. Accessibility & Legibility
* **Contrast Check:** When using the Ignite Orange gradient for buttons, ensure the text inside is either **Pure White** or **Deep Navy** depending on which offers better contrast (WCAG standards).
* **Hover States:** Interactive elements should shift in brightness or depth on hover to provide clear tactile feedback to the user.
